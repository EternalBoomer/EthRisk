# EthRisk site backup

Here you can download the website to run it locally.

There's many ways to set up a localhost. What follows is, I believe, the easiest way to do it in Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install npm

sudo apt-get install http-server

cd '/path/to/folder/'

http-server
```

The server should be up and running, uses 127.0.0.1:8080 by default.

For other OS just use google famalams.
